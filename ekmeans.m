%
% --------------------------- ekmeans algorithm ---------------------------
%
% Equal kmeans algorithm that allows an equal cardinality constraint across
% all clusters (i.e. all clusters have the same number of points).
%
% Random centroids are seeded in the data and data points are assigned to
% these centroids on the basis of their euclidian distance. Assignments and
% centroid positions are iteratively updated. If equal cardinality is
% specified, whenever a cluster becomes too large points in that cluster
% that are closest to any other centroid are removed and reassigned to
% their next closest centroid and all clusters/centroids updated.
%
% -------------------------------- Inputs ---------------------------------
%
% - data:           Matrix where columns are dimensions and rows are data
%                   points specified in the order [y x etc.]
%
% - num_clusters:   Scalar, number of clusters to split data into
%
% - num_iterations: Scalar, number of algorithm iterations
%
% - equal:          Boolean, equal cardinality (1) or not (0)
%
% -------------------------------- Outputs --------------------------------
%
% - assignments:    Num_points * 1 vector where each element is the cluster
%                   assignment of the indexed data point
%
% - centroids:      Num_clusters * num_dimensions matrix where each row is
%                   the mean n-dimensional co-ordinates of the data points
%                   in that cluster
%
% --------------------------- Optional outputs ----------------------------
%
% - counts:         Num_clusters * 1 vector where each element is the
%                   number of data points in that cluster
%
% - mean_error:     Scalar, mean distance from all points to their
%                   centroids
%
% - max_error:      Scalar, maximum distance between any one point and its
%                   centroid
%
